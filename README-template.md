## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

In this challenge, javascript was my main scope of training. So, the input event listener is the new technic that I learned. Monitoring and watching the values inputed in input field and add functionality is the main learning outcome from this challenge. Besides that, I think I start to catch the logic and the uses of DRY principle and use of functions to organise the code, also how and where to use functions properly.

### Continued development

The Main area that I will still work with is my javascript solving problems. I think this is a crucial skill that I must work on, I have already pointed some developement in my skills, especialy that I can analyse others code and before copying it, I can fully understand it and be able to adapt it to my code efficiently.
